# js-pdf-generator

### About

This project was built to test the PDF generation taking an HTML document as a template to be filled with dynamic data sent from the from a client app.

The first committed code was generated by following the tutorial _"How to Create PDFs With Node JS and React"_ ([Youtube](https://youtu.be/bt1tOhUYxvM)).

## Running the Demo

### Pre-requisites

In order to run the demo you must have `node` and `nodemon` installed. To install `nodemon` it run the following on your command line:

```shell
$ npm install -g nodemon
```

### Start the Server

After cloning the repo into your machine you need to start the server:

```shell
$ cd server

$ nodemon index.js

[nodemon] 1.19.1
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `node index.js`
Listening on port 5000
```

As you can see, the server will be listening to requests on port 5000.

### Start the Client

The client is a simple React app with a form where you can add data used to generate the PDF dynamically.

To start the client, open a new command line and start it:

```shell
$ cd client

$ npm start

```
